## Hi there 👋
We are an organization about an operating system in development!!!
if you are **Linux🐧**lovers than follow us!!!

# Our Goal:
Our goal is to create the most sussy operating system ever!!!
And,if you love among us, you may have crossed an Os called amogOS(more info: https://github.com/Amog-OS/AmogOS ), but that was a meme OS!
Ours isn`t though and we will make more apps just for the living of the OS!!!!(and maybe a app store called "sus shop")
